CSS Grid and Flexbox are two modern layout techniques. Understanding their differences helps in choosing the right tool for web design.

## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, best for aligning items in a row or column.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Key Features of Flexbox:
- **One-dimensional**: Works along a single axis (either row or column).
- **Alignment control**: Easily aligns items using `justify-content` and `align-items`.
- **Flexible sizing**: Items grow and shrink based on available space using `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
- **Order control**: Items can be reordered without changing the HTML structure using `order`.

## What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, allowing control over both rows and columns.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### Key Features of CSS Grid:
- **Two-dimensional**: Defines both rows and columns for precise layouts.
- **Explicit positioning**: Place items exactly where needed using `grid-row` and `grid-column`.
- **Auto-placement**: Items are automatically positioned when no specific placement is defined.
- **Flexible track sizing**: Uses `fr` units, percentages, or fixed sizes.

## When to Use Flexbox vs. Grid?

| Feature         | Flexbox                        | CSS Grid                        |
|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Layout Type** | One-dimensional (row/column)  | Two-dimensional (rows & columns) |
| **Alignment**   | Better for alignment & spacing | Precise placement of items       |
| **Responsiveness** | Great for dynamic layouts  | Best for complex grid-based layouts |
| **Use Case**    | Navigation bars, small UI components | Web pages, dashboards, complex layouts |

### Example Use Cases:
- **Use Flexbox for:** Navigation bars, buttons, form layouts.
- **Use Grid for:** Web page layouts, image galleries, complex dashboards.

## Combining Flexbox and Grid

Often, using both together provides the best results. For example, use Grid for page layout and Flexbox for aligning buttons inside a component.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}

.flex-item {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Conclusion

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful tools. Flexbox excels in aligning items within a container, while Grid is best for structuring complex layouts. Knowing when to use each ensures efficient and responsive web designs.
